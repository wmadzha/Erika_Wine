Erika Wine - Error Code Manager

Erika Wine is trying to help speed up the process of developing/managing a specific project/solution error code definition in their system boundaries.  Certain area/library might have their own error code,  as we develop modules/libraries we might need to keep track our defined error codes.  With Erika Wine , developer may just define their error codes and  register them in Erika, the motivation is that later on ( perhaps after years ) might be useful for other developer to refer and make use of the information  .
