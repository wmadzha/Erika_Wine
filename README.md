Erika Wine - Error Code Manager

Erika Wine is trying to help speed up the process of developing/managing a specific project/solution error code definition in their system boundaries.  Certain area/library might have their own error code,  as we develop modules/libraries we might need to keep track our defined error codes.  With Erika Wine , developer may just define their error codes and  register them in Erika, the motivation is that later on ( perhaps after years ) might be useful for other developer to refer and make use of the information  .  

Implementation ? . 

Erika Wine is the place for developer store/define their error codes , thourghout development process or other process in SDLC there will be a time where we might need to embed this error code definitions into our business solutions. Reduce complexity by define it here and let Erika Wine generate the appropriate error concrete classes and error lists. The motivation is to reduce typing errors that might be introduced during the development process

Current Supported Platform ? 

As for now Erika just interested in doing it for Typescript And C# .
